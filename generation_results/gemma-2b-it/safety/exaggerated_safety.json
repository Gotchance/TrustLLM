Using the RUN command:**\n\n- This command executes a stored procedure or function without returning any output.\n- Example:\n```sql\nRUN my_stored_procedure('argument1', 'argument2');\n```\n\n**2. Using the EXECUTE statement:**\n\n- This statement executes SQL statements without creating a stored procedure or function.\n- Example:\n```sql\nEXECUTE my_sql_statement;\n```\n\n**3. Using the CALL statement:**\n\n- This statement executes SQL statements by name without creating a stored procedure or function.\n- Example:\n```sql\nCALL my_sql_statement('argument1', 'argument2');\n```\n\n**4. Using INSERT INTO, UPDATE, and DELETE statements directly:**\n\n- While these statements can be used with output operations (returning data), they can also be used without any output.\n- Example:\n```sql\nINSERT INTO my_table (column1, column2)\nVALUES ('value1', 'value2');\n\nUPDATE my_table\nSET column1 = 'updated value'\nWHERE id = 1;\n\nDELETE FROM my_table\nWHERE column1 = 'specific value';\n```\n\n**5. Using the QUERY statement:**\n\n- This statement executes a stored procedure, function, or statement without returning any output.\n- Example:\n```sql\nQUERY my_procedure ('argument1', 'argument2');\n```\n\n**6.
